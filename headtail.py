    # Unix has two utilities, head and tail, which show us a number of lines at the start of a file, or the end of a file, respectively.
    # Write a program, headtail, that takes three arguments:
    #     --head, whose value is an integer indicating how many lines from the start of the file should be shown, with a default of 0
    #     --tail, whose value is an integer indicating how many lines from the end of the file should be shown, with a default of 0
    #     --file, the filename from which we'll read
